# BlazorConf2023 State Management Demo

This is the repository for the BlazorConf2023. In this repo you'll find a display of different strategies to handle state management in Blazor applications.

During the session I've shown 3 different approaches to the state management problem:
- CascadingParameters and CascadingValues to propagate state data from a root component;
- State Container Service aka inject a "singleton" service which represents state data in your components via ASP.NET DI;
- State management done with Fluxor library using the Flux pattern;

In this repository you will find also a "bonus" approach based on System.Reactive (aka RX.NET) and Observables objects.

The link to the video recording of the session will be available as soon as possible.
